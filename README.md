Silicone membrane button force-curve meter.

Force-curve measurement is a technique used to assess the mechanical properties of materials, such as silicon buttons, by measuring the relationship between applied force and the resulting deformation. For silicon buttons, this method typically involves applying a controlled force to the surface of the button using a probe or actuator and recording the corresponding displacement. The resulting force-displacement curve provides insights into the material's stiffness, elasticity, and mechanical response under load. It helps in determining key parameters like actuation force, tactile feedback, and wear characteristics, which are crucial for quality control and design optimization of silicon buttons used in electronics.
